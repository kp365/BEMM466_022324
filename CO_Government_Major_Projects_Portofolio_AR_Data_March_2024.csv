We anticipate the following benefits - an increased robustness of vetting, productivity improvements and economic benefits from reducing ""street to seat"" times and reducing attrition. Increasing the technological capabilities will reduce the time spent by vetting officers accessing disparate data sources. In creating additional capacity through increased efficiency, we will create a continuous improvement fund which will be used to build a deeper quality of capability across vetting."

 The Whole Life Costs reflect the annual contract values in the preferred bids for the 4 procurements which are now complete, covering the Performance Partner, Operational Security and Hard and Soft FM.

Overall the WSTP preferred option was expected to increase costs by 30.6m. However, this results from the investment in GPA staffing which is common to all of the considered options to adequately manage the growing estate and supply chain; and the introduction of the Performance Partner as the critical factor in driving enhanced customer and client benefit. The Baseline used is the OBC preferred option._x000D_
The latest forecast is a benefit of 35.71m as a result of the preferred bids received during the award process, where the bids were below the anticipated rates based on GPA's Should Cost model."
