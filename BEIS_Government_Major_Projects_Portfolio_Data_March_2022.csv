A GDF is the internationally agreed and only viable permanent answer to the UK's existing legacy of Highly radioactive waste.   As a nationally significant infrastructure programme a GDF will also provide an opportunity to sustainably boost the economy of the host region and local community to transform itself for many generations. The programme also supports the delivery of the UK's nuclear new build programme as the Government needs to be satisfied that effective arrangements exist or will exist to manage and dispose of the wastes they will produce before development consents for new nuclear power stations are granted.","","Amber","Compared to financial year 20/21-Q4, the Infrastructure Project Authority's Delivery Confidence Assessment rating at 21/22-Q4 increased from Green to Amber		
The SRO SQA has changed from green to amber due to ongoing funding constraints.   The programme faces large uncertainties at this stage due to the site selection process; Until we confirm a willing community, a suitable site, and test the site characteristics, we cannot be confident of timescales and costs.  
-	Uncertainty in finding a willing community continues to reduce as three Community Partnerships have now been formed and a working group progressing towards Community Partnership. There is a pipeline of further potential communities with good site prospects.  
-	There has been considerable progress with enabling activities to support the current and next phases: business cases for major permissions work, and a property value protection scheme are in progress. Plans are underway to start seismic investigations of potential sites in Copeland. 
The transformation and capability build of the organisation continues with development to support seismic surveys and technical evaluation activities. Confidence in engaging volunteer communities has grown further with the formation of three community partnerships in West Cumbria and a fourth working group in East Lindsey.  Active and focussed engagement continues with additional communities.   The transformation of the GDF programme continues with ongoing capability development and recruitment to meet the changing nature of the programme preparing for the next significant phase - concept design and site suitability.  The GDF is now part of the Major Capital Programmes Directorate of the newly formed NDA Nuclear Waste Services.  
It should be noted that the GDF programme spans a significant time period on a whole life basis and is still at a very early stage in the lifecycle, construction is due to start in the 2040s.  The programme still faces exceptional uncertainty levels at this stage with success dependent on agreeing a site with a willing community and the associated complexity of geology.","2008-06-30","2040-12-31","Compared to 2021-Q4, your project end-date remained scheduled to finish on 31 DEC  2040  .

However, many work-arounds have been effective in continuing engagement, noting that the communities set the pace for their own progress through the 'willing community' process.  3 community partnerships and now been formed and a fourth working group is preparing for Community Partnership formation and initial community investment grants have been approved.

Also, ongoing CoVID impacts with more virtual events scheduled over the year and the associated reduction in spend.
2) Budget constraints applied to the final quarter of the year have resulted in deferrals, including the next phase of the borehole sealing demonstration, and slow down in some of the technical support activities and associated reduction in spend.  Decisions were taken to prioritise activities that support the critical and key paths to the first major decision point in 2025/26.

The revised Whole Life Cost (WLC) envelope includes a range of scenarios associated with the waste inventory and the significant levels of variability associated with the location and the possible geological complexities.
Current estimates are between £10.2bn-£27.3bn cost to HMG (as stated in the Q3 report) to dispose of the legacy waste, rising to £20.3-£53.3bn (aligned to the 2019 approved FBC) for the whole inventory, including an allowance for risk and optimism bias.

The existing facility is 60 years old and cannot provide long-term capability so new analytical facilities need to be established. The Replacement Analytical Project has therefore been initiated to deliver future analytical capability to the Sellafield site, through a major modification of the National Nuclear Laboratory Central Laboratory.  Key modifications are provision of standalone Highly Active (HA), Medium Active (MA) and Special Nuclear Material (SNM) analytical capability.

This work produced its first unassured outputs in November 2021. Initial output has indicated a project completion range of November 2028 - November 2031 with a most likely outturn cost of £900m to £1.1bn (nb. pre-optimisation exercise / risk modelling) comparable to the OBC P50 of £680m (fully escalated). The Executive level sponsored Challenge & Optimisation process is continuing which is reviewing the scope, constraints, risks and execution approach in order to potentially reduce the schedule and cost. The output from the activities underway will drive the most up-to-date assessment of cost and schedule outturn, providing a first updated forecast output in July 2022,  and inform the activities required to realise the opportunities ahead of the next formal sanction gate (the FBC) around July 2024.","2016-09-26","2028-07-10","Compared to 2021-Q4, your project end-date remained scheduled to finish on 10 JUL  2028  .

The project has delivered less scope than originally planned due to performance issues including the multiple impacts of COVID; design deliverables delayed due to revised working arrangements and restrictions, limited site access causing delays to early construction enabling works, resource recruitment/retention issues and delays placing supply chain contracts.
