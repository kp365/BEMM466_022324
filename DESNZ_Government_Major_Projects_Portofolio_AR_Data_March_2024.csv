The project's baseline Whole Life monetised benefits is 4782m. Benefits are realised because homes will operate more efficiently and use less energy if the fabric and heating system of the homes are upgraded. Occupiers will therefore be spending less money on heating their homes (with an expected annual bill saving of 200-700 based on current energy prices). In most cases, this will also mean lower carbon emissions. There are also wider societal benefits including improved air quality and reduced costs on the energy supply grids, from reduced energy use and carbon emissions. There are health benefits, as cold homes impact health. A side effect of reduced energy demand may be that because occupiers are saving money, they are happy to use some of those savings to make their homes warmer. For example, turning the heating up from 18 to 21 degrees. This is called Comfort Savings."
